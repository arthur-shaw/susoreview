The goal of susoreview is to offer tools for the process of automating
review and rejection of interviews. The tools span the full pipeline of
that process:

-   Creating attributes, developed from microdata and used for
    identifying issues;
-   Creating issues, devised from one or more attribute or directly from
    serious flaws in the data; and
-   Executing reject/review workflow, by:
    -   adding issues based on interview metadata (e.g., number of
        unanswered questions)
    -   checking for relevant comments that require review before
        rejection
    -   flagging persistent issues that require actions outside of
        rejection
    -   constructing rejection messages from all issues relevant for an
        interview
    -   posting comments to specific questions of the questionnaire
    -   rejecting the interviews via the appropriate API endpoint as a
        function of each interviewâ€™s status
