The goal of susoreview is to offer tools for the process of automating review and rejection of interviews. The tools span the full pipeline of that process:

- Creating attributes, developed from microdata and used for identifying issues;
- Creating issues, devised from one or more attribute or directly from serious flaws in the data; and
- Executing reject/review workflow, by:
  + adding issues based on interview metadata (e.g., number of unanswered questions)
  + checking for relevant comments that require review before rejection
  + flagging persistent issues that require actions outside of rejection
  + constructing rejection messages from all issues relevant for an interview
  + posting comments to specific questions of the questionnaire
  + rejecting the interviews via the appropriate API endpoint as a function of each interview's status
